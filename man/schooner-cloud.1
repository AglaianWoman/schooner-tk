.SH "NAME"
\fBschooner\-cloud\fR \- create a cloud mask from a landsat 8 QA band
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBschooner\-cloud\fR \fIquality\-assessment\-band\fR\.tif \fIout\fR\.tif
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBschooner\-blend\fR tool creates a cloud and snow mask from a landsat 8 quality assessment band\. These bands are distributed within Landsat 8 tarballs and are named like:
.
.P
\fIlandsat\-id\fR_BQA\.TIF
.
.P
This kind of mask is useful when averaging multiple datasets together with \fBschooner\-blend\fR\. Once you\'ve run this command to create a mask you need to use something like:
.
.P
gdal_calc\.py \-A \fImask\fR\.tif \-B \fIlandsat\fR\.tif \-\-calc="A*B" \-\-allBands=B \-\-overwrite \-\-type=Byte
.
.P
to apply it to your final image\.
.
.SH "CAVEATS"
This tool only works with Landsat 8 quality bands and removes that band\'s classified snow and cloud flags\. It uses the masks defined in the Landsat 8 documentation at:
.
.IP "" 4

.P
\fBschooner\-cloud\fR treats all "maybe" bits as definitely classified as cloudy\.
.
.P
As of this writing the Landsat program is reprocessing old images to include a cloud flag using the cfmask algorithm, and this tool is expected to work when the QA bands are updated\.
