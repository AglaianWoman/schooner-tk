schooner-multibalance(1) -- color correct a batch of images
===========================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`schooner-blend` [<datasets>...] out.tif

## DESCRIPTION

The **schooner-contrast** tool attempts to automatically color
correct a landsat image. It uses two algorithms, the first is CLAHE
(Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) which attempts
to color correct an image while improving the local contrast of the
image.

The other is simple histogram stretching and clipping. The tool
calculates a histogram by band, and stretches the raster values to
the range 0 to 255. It also discards the top and bottom 0.05% of
values.

## CAVEATS

Unlike **landsat-util**, **schooner-contrast** does not perform
gamma correction. If you are working with landsat 8 images it is
probably better to use **landsat-util**'s builtin color correction.

If you are working with older landsat data, or data from sensors like
MODIS, **schooner-contrast** works acceptably well.
